Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'.

Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?\\nSo KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.\\nThe wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.\\nAfter tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.\\nGiven the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.\\nOf course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…\\n\\nMar 11, 2022',\n",

Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?\\n\\nPours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing\\n\\nThe nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon\\n\\nMan, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime\\n\\nA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness\\n\\nI won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one.

Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission\\n\\nS: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins\\n\\nT: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions\\n\\nM: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques\\n\\nO: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step\\n\\nJan 01, 2022',\n",

Pardon me i have to sit down. Mouth feel is, well 11. Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'. It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy.\",\n",
       " 'So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…',\n",
       " \"2021 vintage, bottle #79Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacingThe nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbonMan, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. SublimeA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetnessI won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one.

       "      <th>So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…</th>\n",

       "      <th>2021 vintage, bottle #79Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacingThe nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbonMan, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. SublimeA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetnessI won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Awesome, from the minute you pour it to the minute you taste it. The chocolate notes, the barrel &amp; bourbon notes, the stickiness on the palette. This is a masterpiece in how a big beer should be developed, blended, and aged. Drink closer to 50'F and all the wonderful notes will come out. Loads of chocolate, caramel and vanilla notes, slight tannin from the oak and hint of bourbon. Lingering mouthfeel that lets you enjoy all the flavors and savor it. Nothing out of balance. Loved it.</th>\n",

Grainy start, and a hoppy finish that is light but still discernibly hoppy. Totally drinkable.</th>\n",

Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Mildly increasing lingering pepper heat through the glass; pleasant and not overwhelming. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. Far exceeded all expectations, definitely one of the best I've had in this category. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Bud Light and Clamato flavors; with nice malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example.</th>\n",

       "      <th>$1.29 USD/12 fl oz can at a beer store in Englewood Village, Colorado, U.S.A.5% ABV. \"100% Malt Classic\" (whatever that means). \"Premium quality lager.\"From their website: \"Kloud is made with fermented concentrate without dilution with water, using the original gravity method. It is made with raw materials chosen through a strict selection process, providing an authentic European-style beer flavor. The name Kloud is a composite of the “K” from Korea and ‘cloud’, which is similar in appearance to beer foam. The hope to provide a beer that represents Korea has been expressed in the product name. \"APPEARANCE: Looks filtered and well carbonated with a slightly foamy head. Vibrant. Looks innocuous if a bit insipid...AROMA: Slightly doughy slighty raw malty sweetness. Just heavy 6-row across the board. Honeyed sweetness. A hint of cidery cane sugar character.No hop aromatics. No yeast aromatics. No off flavours.TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Honeyed malt sweetness, cheap 6-row barley/pale malt. That's it. A very simple shallow lager.Oddly medium-bodied, boasting a bit more of a robust feel on the palate than I expected in a Korean budget lager. Smooth, wet, not unrefreshing, well carbonated. I guess I expected a watery thin beer, but this has a good deal more body - I guess that's the \"rich\" quality the label advertises.OVERALL: An inoffensive albeit oversweet budget lager with a bit more body than its Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese import competition. I have a sneaking suspicion the 1.6L PET bottles they sell in Korea are a good deal cheaper than $1.29 USD/12 fl oz, and at a much better price point I could see myself swilling this over kimchi when in Seoul, but it's not a beer to seek out and I wouldn't bother with it again while outside Korea.High D+ / NOT RECOMMENDED</th>\n",
